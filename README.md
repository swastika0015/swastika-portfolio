AstroPaper is a minimal, responsive, accessible and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. This theme is designed and crafted based on [my personal blog](https://satnaing.dev/blog).

This theme follows best practices and provides accessibility out of the box. Light and dark mode are supported by default. Moreover, additional color schemes can also be configured.

## Customization

I have customized the Astropaper blog theme to make it a portfolio website by including the projects with the recent blogs.

In future, I will be adding more features like skills or talk. It can be done by creating new directory in `src/content` and making the relevant changes.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog` directory.
All projects are stored in `src/content/project` directory.
